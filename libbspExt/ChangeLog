 Changes since release 1.5:
    - 2010/02/12 (T.S.) Let dummy implementation of clear_hostbridge_errors()
      return -1 if called with nonzero 'enableMCP' argument.
    - 2009/08/06 (T.S.)
      bspExt.h: Added extern "C" linkage for C++ inclusion (Thanks to
      Daron Chabot).
 Changes since release 1.4:
    - 2008/10/25: new, more liberal 'SLAC' license.
    - 2008/10/4 (T.S.): Added weak alias for _BSP_clear_hostbridge_errors()
	  so that we can link on BSPs w/o that routine.
 Changes since release 1.3-beta:
	- replaced #ifdef <ppc_cpu_flavor> in memProbe.c by a run-time
	  check (using libcpu/cpuIdent.h).
	- make ISR wrapper available to other architectures (i386 has no
	  shareable extensions to date).
 Changes since release 1.2-beta:
	- IABR handler support
	- improved DABR support
	- ABI for hooking into exception handler
	- merged Kate Feng's modifications for supporting 7450 CPUs
    - don't enable MCP in hid0 fi clear_hostbridge_errors() returns -1
      (give the BSP a chance to indicate that there *is* no MCP line)
 Changes since release 1.1-beta:
	- wrapped the braindead IRQ API of the 'new exception handling' BSPs.
      The new API allows for interrupt sharing (crucial for PCI) and
      passing an ISR argument (also crucial for PCI / shared interrupts).
